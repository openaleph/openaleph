"""Per-request batch loader for cached pydantic resources.

The :class:`Resolver` is constructed once per HTTP request and exposes
typed ``get`` / ``get_many`` / ``get_etag`` / ``invalidate`` methods.

Three layers, in priority order:

1. **Per-instance local dict** (request-scoped). Garbage collected when
   the request ends. Holds both hits and *negative* hits — see the
   ``_MISSING`` sentinel below — so a request asking for the same
   missing id twice issues only one upstream call.
2. **Persistent ``anystore.Store``** — Redis in production, ``memory://``
   in tests, file/S3 in offline modes. Same code path either way; the
   resolver doesn't know the backend. Misses are *never* persisted to
   this layer (only to local), to avoid poisoning the store with stale
   negatives across requests.
3. **Upstream fetch** via the registry (DB / Elasticsearch / wherever
   the owning logic module knows how to load from).

The hot-path read uses ``model_validate=False`` so cached payloads
skip pydantic validators. They were already validated at write time
and the persistent store is a trust boundary the resolver controls
end-to-end.

The resolver also doubles as the source of truth for HTTP cache
validators: every cached object exposes a content-derived ETag
(:meth:`Resolver.get_etag`, :meth:`Resolver.get_many_etag`)
which the API layer puts on the response so browsers can revalidate
with ``If-None-Match`` and get a 304. ETags rotate automatically
whenever :meth:`Resolver.invalidate` is called from a mutation path,
so the wire-level cache stays consistent with the backing store
without any per-endpoint bookkeeping.

Spurious ``invalidate()`` calls are cheap — content-derived ETags
stay stable across re-fetches when the upstream content is unchanged,
so the client still gets a 304. Mutation paths can invalidate
liberally without paying for it on the wire.
